# Resume DB
##### A database for managing resume content

## How It Works

2. Create "resumes" which are just collections of your experiences/education/etc.
3. Copy & paste the generated text into a nicely formatted word doc

## Installation
1. Create a new table in your MySQL DB
2. Import the database structure from `DB.sql`
2. Update the credentials in `config example.ini`
3. Rename `config example.ini` to `config.ini`
4. Place the code on a server capable of running PHP
5. Navigate to the `public` directory to access the website
